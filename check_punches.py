# Script to check if SI-cards listed in check.tsv has 
# punched in the controls listed in the same file.
# Each line in the file "check.tsv" has the format:
#
# SI-card_number<tab>electronic_control_number
#
# E.g.
#
# 721120	43
#
# All the files ending in .csv in the same directory are searched.
# The format of the CSV files is assumed to be that which is saved
# by Sportident Config+ when reading out the backup memory of 
# SI stations and saving via the function "Save current view" 
# (or something along those lines).
#
# In case not all control codes mentioned in check.tsv are found 
# in the csv files, a list of the missing control codes is printed.
#
# This program was hacked together by Per Magnusson, LinkÃ¶pings OK,
# on 2019-07-25 and improved on 2019-07-27.

# The program is public domain and comes without any warranty. Feel free
